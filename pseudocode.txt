Includes
1) timer
2) localStorage
3) creation of objects, which is new outside of the json(parse) thing. so we'll need to read up on that
4) variables to hold scores
5) variables to hold questions
6) decrementing time, and adding or subtracting from that time based on answers

Questions that need to be answered:
1) how to create objects? what does that look like with answering questions in javascript?
2) is the quiz multiple pages? or are we hiding text once a button has been clicked?
- I think this has to do with rendering, and we won't be doing multiple pages
3) What questions do you want to use?
